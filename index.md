# Hello! 👋

I'm **Intak Hwang** (sp301415).

I'm a Ph.D. student in [Cryptography & Privacy Lab](https://crypto.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National Unversity, advised by [Yongsoo Song](https://yongsoosong.github.io). I’m interested in post-quantum cryptographic protocols based on lattices, including but not limited to Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

I also love [watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/sp301415/). I've directed several short films, and I'm eager to continue doing so.

Visit my Korean blog [**Null Space**](https://blog.sp301415.com) for more of my writings!
