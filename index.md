# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Hwang In Tak** (sp301415).

I'm an Integrated M.S./Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Enginnering at Seoul National Unversity(SNU). My advisor is [Prof. Yongsoo Song](https://yongsoosong.github.io). I am interested in theory and application of modern cryptography and security protocols.

For side projects, I'm developing & writing a sokoban puzzle game in [Team Invertible](https://twitter.com/team_invertible). Oh, and I also love [watching films](https://letterboxd.com/sp301415).


Visit my Korean blog [**Null Space**](https://blog.sp301415.com) for more of my writings!
