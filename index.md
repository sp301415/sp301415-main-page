# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Hwang In Tak** (sp301415). 

I'm a mathematics & computer science student in DGIST, with a deep interest in cryptography.  I play CTF competitions with [CodeRed](https://ko-kr.facebook.com/Codered.hackerteam/) from time to time. I'm developing & writing a sokoban puzzle game in [Team Invertible](https://twitter.com/team_invertible). Oh, and I also love [watching films](https://letterboxd.com/sp301415).


If you are more interested, take a look at my [**CV**](/assets/CV.pdf) or visit my korean blog, [**Null Space**](https://blog.sp301415.com).
